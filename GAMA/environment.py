    """
    Extracts coordinates that fall within a certain radius around a point.
    
    Inputs:
    -------
    data : array-like
        (N, 2) array, with each row being a point coordinate. Declination
        values are in the first column, right ascension values in the second.
        T his is the dataset of coordinates among which we want to find the
        ones that fall within a certain radius using the great-circle distance.
           
    point : array-like
        Cooridnate tuple with the declination value as the first entry and
        the right ascension value as the second entry. This is the point
        around which we are looking for coordinateÅ› within a radius.
            
    radius : float or int
        The radius around the provided point in which extracted coordinates
        have to fall in order to be returned as valid coordinates to return.

    --------
    radius_data : array-like
        The cut-down dataset, meaning only the coordinates of points in the
        provided dataset that fall within the given radius.

    ----
    The whole things runs in around 0.7 seconds per point, with a dataset of
    100,000 coordinates. For a speed-up, it is embarrassingly parallelizable.
    It should also be tested on the real dataset to make sure that everything
    works as intended. Batteries not included.
